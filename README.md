Basic-x86 is a basic interpreter developed completely in assembly language and designed for IBM compatible computers,
which therefore use a processor belonging to the x86 family.
The interpreter does not want to be a professional and really usable interpreter (also because who still programs in BASIC?) But a simple project to improve my skills as a programmer.
The BASIC interpreter is neither efficient nor pleasant to use, it does not make use of all the information about compilers, but it uses a part of it and limits itself to sketching out 
the functioning of a real interpreter.
